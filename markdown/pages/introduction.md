<span class="drop">M</span>ental health disorders (MHD) are between three and six times more common among individuals involved in the criminal justice system compared to the general population.[^1] In the United States, 24 percent of individuals who are incarcerated reported receiving a clinical diagnosis or treatment for a MHD within the past year and 49 percent reported experiencing symptoms of a MHD.[^2] Research estimates 1 million individuals with a MHD are on probation or parole in the United States.[^3]

Despite the disproportionately high prevalence of MHDs in the criminal justice system, many individuals do not receive treatment while incarcerated.[^4] Nationally, sixty-three percent of individuals with a history of a MHD received treatment in prison from 2011 to 2012, and only 45 percent of those jailed received treatment.[^5] In addition, individuals with a MHD spend significantly more time in jail compared to those without a MHD.[^6]

Upon release from prison, individuals with a MHD on parole are nearly twice as likely to be reincarcerated within one year of release than those without mental health disorders.[^7] This creates a problematic cycle where individuals with MHDs are released into the community, only to likely be returned to the justice system in the future.[^8] These issues, among others, have led to the development of interventions targeted to justice-involved individuals with a MHD.

A very small proportion of the crimes committed by individuals with mental health disorders are a direct result of their mental health symptoms; researchers estimate about 1 in 10 arrested individuals with a MHD are involved with the justice system due to mental health symptoms.[^9] Moreover, the idea that MHDs are a primary cause of criminality does not align with the fact that the vast majority of individuals with a MHD (treated or untreated) do not commit crimes.[^10] This flaw in the rationale for providing interventions that mainly emphasize provision of mental health treatment may in part explain why such programs and practices have failed to reduce the overrepresentation of individuals with MHDs in the criminal justice system.[^11] Research has shown individuals with MHDs have largely the same predictors and risk factors for criminal justice involvement as individuals without MHDs.[^12]

_Evidence-based practices or programs_ (EBPs) have demonstrated consistently positive outcomes through empirical research and evaluation. Promising programs and practices are associated with positive outcomes but need further research to support them as EBPs.[^13] There are many EBPs for treating MHDs and there are several EBPs for preventing/reducing criminality. However, EBPs addressing mental health outcomes often have little to no impact on public safety outcomes.[^14] There is markedly little empirical research on EBPs from the mental health field tailored for the justice-involved population or on criminal justice practices adapted to the abilities of individuals with a MHD.[^15] More research is needed to gauge outcomes from adapted models relative to the expected outcomes from an EBP implemented with high levels of fidelity.[^16] 

This continuum was created to present the current state of research regarding programs and practices targeted to individuals with mental health disorders at various stages of the criminal justice system following the sequential intercept model (SIM). The SIM is a way to conceptualize points throughout the criminal justice system where individuals with MHD can be diverted to mental health treatment; or if the individual is already in the criminal justice system, programs and practices aim to help individuals avoid future involvement with the justice system (e.g. reentry).[^17] Interventions at each intercept can be evaluated on measures in the following domains:

-	Criminal justice outcomes.
-	Mental health (clinical) outcomes.
-	Costs and savings.
-	Client and staff perceptions and satisfaction.[^18]
