1. What is included under the term “mental health disorders” (MHDs) is defined differently by many programs, policies, and in various research studies.[^1] Clinical diagnostic criteria for specific disorders are available in in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).[^2]
2. Individuals with MHDs have largely the same predictors and risk factors for criminal justice involvement as individuals without MHDs.[^3]
3. Individuals with MHDs in the justice system share many of the same treatment needs as individuals with MHDs who are not involved in the justice system.[^4]
4. The criminal justice system has the primary goal of promoting public safety, whereas the primary goal of the mental health system is to improve mental health symptoms.[^5]
5. A number of evaluations of programs and practices found no association between criminal justice outcomes and mental health outcomes (i.e. many interventions impact one group of factors but not the other).[^6]
6. The availability and capacity of mental health resources in a community may impact the ways in which the criminal justice system and the mental health system are able to collaborate.[^7]
7. Mental health treatment and services should be provided by a practitioner with appropriate training, and in some cases, the necessary professional licenses.[^8]
8. Receipt of mental health treatment in the community may be impacted by the consumer’s insurance status or ability to pay out of pocket.[^9] In Cook County, individuals are screened for Medicaid eligibility and offered assistance with the application for enrollment during the jail intake process.[^10] For more information on facilitating access to publicly funded behavioral healthcare benefits for justice-involved individuals, see [Critical Connections: Getting People Leaving Prison and Jail the Mental Health Care and Substance Use Treatment They Need](https://www.bja.gov/publications/Critical-Connections-Full-Report.pdf).
9. Illinois state law and federal law require that insurance plans provide equal coverage for behavioral health and physical health benefits; under the Affordable Care Act, mental health and substance use disorder treatment are categorized as essential health benefits, which requires at least a minimum level of coverage in these areas for many employer-sponsored plans.[^11] For more information, see [Mental Health and Addiction Parity in Illinois](http://thekennedyforumillinois.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Summary-of-HB-1-Parity-Provisions.pdf).
10. If an individual is receiving mental health treatment in the community, involvement with the criminal justice system has the potential to interrupt receipt of care, with possible negative effects.[^12]
11. Strict criteria for voluntary or involuntary psychiatric hospitalization may lead to arrests or revocations of supervision with the intention of providing access to treatment.[^13]
12. Any change (or lack of change) in future outcomes due to treatment is dependent in part on the quality of mental health treatment services received, which is often beyond the control of the justice system.[^14]
13.	Involvement with the criminal justice system as well as having an MHD can cause an individual to feel stigmatized, which can impact their willingness to seek services, including mental health treatment.[^15]
14.	Participants may view treatment mandated by the criminal justice system as coercive, which has the potential to impact the effectiveness of the treatment.[^16]
15.	Studies should control for a participant’s level of risk for recidivism when evaluating interventions.[^17]
16.	Individuals with co-occurring disorders can also benefit from EBPs for substance use disorders. For more information, see [Reducing Substance Use Disorders and Related Offending: A Continuum of Evidence-Informed Practices in the Criminal Justice System](https://sudcontinuum.icjia.cloud/).
17.	Community-based providers tend to employ more evidence-based practices compared to practices used in institutional settings.[^18]
18.	Improvements in technology have increased the use of “telemedicine” which allows mental health professionals to provide treatment remotely; this practice has been beneficial in increasing access to mental health treatment for individuals in correctional facilities, while eliminating some issues that arise from either transporting individuals or bringing mental health professionals into secure facilities for consultation.[^19] In some departments, law enforcement officers are also able to consult with mental health professionals regarding crisis incidents while in the field.[^20]
19.	Information about an individual’s mental health may be subject to the protections of HIPAA and should be treated with all necessary protections to confidentiality.[^21] For more information, see [Information Sharing in Criminal Justice-Mental Health Collaborations: Working with HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws](https://www.bja.gov/Publications/CSG_CJMH_Info_Sharing.pdf).[^22]
20.	The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s working definition of recovery from MHDs is “a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential.”[^23] Recovery support can be offered through long-term services that aim to promote improved individual functioning and reductions in symptoms through ongoing treatment and community-based programming.[^24]
