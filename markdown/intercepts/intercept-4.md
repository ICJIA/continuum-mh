Reentry programs aim to improve the continuity of care for individuals as they exit a correctional facility or hospital to return to the community. During the first hours, days, and weeks following release, individuals may experience a heightened need for mental health services.[^1] However, many find that other needs, such as shelter and income, must be prioritized over treatment.[^2] A study in Washington state found that only half of individuals with mental health disorders (MHDs) received mental health services in the community during the year following release and only 16 percent received services in at least nine of the first 12 months after release.[^3] In addition, individuals with MHDs reported more challenges with housing, employment, family support, and criminal behavior upon returning to the community, compared to those without MHDs.[^4]

Correctional reentry programs ideally engage individuals in pre-release planning to address mental health needs during the transition back to the community and connecting with community-based providers for long-term treatment.[^5] Participation in a reentry program for mental health may be voluntary or involuntary (i.e. a condition of parole supervision). A meta-analysis found interventions in a correctional facility or forensic hospital, followed by mental health services in the community, can decrease the likelihood of recidivism.[^6]

Services for individuals with MHDs reentering the community should be individually tailored to achieve the optimum level of treatment and supervision. It is recommended that programs employ a structure of graduated sanctions and incentives to promote adherence to treatment plans.[^7]

## Goals:

Reentry programs that promote mental health treatment in the community seek to:

-	Provide continuous mental health care from the time of release.[^8]
-	Reduce psychiatric hospitalizations.[^9]
-	Prevent future involvement with the justice system.[^10]

## Eligibility:

Eligibility for reentry programs with an emphasis on mental health treatment varies, but some key factors include:

-	Referral from jail, prison, or a forensic hospital.[^11]
-	Severity of mental health diagnosis.[^12]
- Incarceration for a nonviolent offense, or assessment of a low risk for violence upon release.[^13]
-	Multiple prior arrests or incarcerations.[^14]
-	Functional abilities below a certain threshold in areas such as employment, interpersonal relationships, reasoning, thought processes, and temperament.[^15]

## Program Models:

Reentry programs with a focus on MHDs often follow the models of: 

-	_Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)_, where a multidisciplinary team coordinates and provides services to a small caseload of clients with high levels of need for mental health treatment.
-	_Intensive Case Management (ICM)_, where a case manager facilitates linkages to appropriate community mental health services.[^16]

While the practices of ACT and ICM may be considered evidence-based for improving clinical mental health outcomes, research has found clients often experienced no significant difference in criminal justice outcomes (e.g. arrests, days in jail) compared to clients who received treatment as usual.[^17] ACT is more expensive than ICM; however, both are less expensive than incarcerating an individual.[^18]

ACT and ICM have been adapted for justice-involved individuals and are known as Forensic Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) and Forensic Intensive Case Management (FICM), respectively. The more narrow target population of FACT and FICM allows for the inclusion of criminal justice stakeholders to the case management process and have the primary aim of reducing recidivism.

	<summary>Forensic Assertive Community Treatment (FACT)</summary>

Based on the ACT model, FACT programs serve the justice-involved population with the highest levels of mental health needs and greatest risk for negative behaviors (e.g. recidivism, self-harm).[^19] A multidisciplinary treatment team that includes stakeholders like a parole officer, psychiatrist, and case manager is available 24/7 to proactively address or respond to participants’ needs, such as mental health and substance use disorder treatment, transportation assistance, and vocational support.[^20] FACT specifically aims to reduce rearrests and reincarceration.[^21] FACT also leverages criminal justice sanctions (e.g. technical violation of parole) to promote compliance with the treatment plan.[^22]

The duration and intensity of FACT is based on the individual’s needs over time. This may create a potential risk of dependency on the intensive service provision and raise questions about long-term sustainability.[^23] The reduction in jail days associated with one FACT program led to estimated annual savings in jail costs of more than $200,000 for a group of 30 clients.[^24] However, due to high treatment costs per participant (estimated at $14,000 annually in 2013), the Washington State Institute for Public Policy estimated gains in estimated benefits of FACT would not surpass the program costs.[^25]

While ACT is an evidence-based program model, FACT is still considered a promising program model.[^26] [The National Registry for Evidence-based Programs and Practices found the FACT program model to be promising](https://nrepp.samhsa.gov/ProgramProfile.aspx?id=184#show3) in achieving the outcomes of both reduced criminal/delinquent behavior and increased mental health and/or substance use treatment.

#### Research Evidence: 

Research indicates FACT may be able to:

- Increase receipt of mental health treatment services.[^27]
-	Decrease new jail bookings.[^28]
-	Decrease jail days.[^29]
-	Decrease psychiatric hospital days.[^30]
-	Reduce costs from inpatient treatment and jail stays.[^31]

- [Thresholds Justice Program: Chicago](http://www.thresholds.org/our-work/programs/justice-program/)

<details>
	
<summary>Forensic Intensive Case Management (FICM)</summary>

Based on ICM, the FICM model for justice-involved individuals is typically considered less intensive than FACT.[^32] Case managers under this model have individual caseloads, are not available 24/7, and provide linkages to mental health treatment rather than directly providing treatment.[^33] A case management approach should promote sustained communication between treatment providers and parole officers for individuals on supervision.[^34]

#### Research Evidence: 

Research indicates FICM may be able to:

- Decrease rearrests.[^35]
-	Increase time in the community (i.e. not in prison/jail or a forensic hospital).[^36]
-	Increase medication compliance.[^37]
-	Increase mental health counseling attendance.[^38]

FICM is considered a promising program model to help participants reduce further contact with the criminal justice system and to improve symptoms of MHDs.[^39]
