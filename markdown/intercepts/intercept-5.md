Individuals with mental health disorders (MHDs) under community supervision (probation or parole) by the criminal justice system are at higher risk for violating the terms of their supervision and are nearly twice as likely to have their probation or parole revoked than those without an MHD.[^1] This may be due to: 

-	Difficulty complying with conditions of their supervision such as maintaining employment. 
-	Sentences with numerous additional supervision conditions such as attending frequent mental health or substance use disorder treatment. 
-	Probation and parole officer biases resulting in closer supervision or a lower threshold for revocation.[^2]

The Council for State Governments recommends the following to community corrections departments working with individuals with MHDs:

-	Tailor supervision conditions to the needs and abilities of individuals with MHDs.
-	Ensure government benefits for which individuals are eligible are reinstated immediately after release from custody.
-	Create specialty mental health caseloads for probation and parole officers and provide these officers training to work with individuals with MHDs.
-	Establish clear guidelines for probation and parole officers and clients on compliance with supervision conditions and consequences for violations of those conditions.[^3]

## Goals:

The goals of probation and parole programs that specialize in working with individuals with MHDs include:

-	Increase successful compliance with community supervision conditions.
-	Improve public safety by reducing the commission of new crimes.
-	Provide more/better access to mental health treatment and other supportive services in the community.

## Program Models & Research Evidence:

<details>
	<summary>Specialized Probation for Individuals with MHDs</summary>

Many probation departments designate specialty caseloads for clients with MHDs.[^4] Probation officers assigned to these caseloads receive ongoing training on supervising individuals with MHDs, safety, psychiatric medications, and working with the mental health system.[^5] These probation officers typically have smaller caseloads than standard probation, at 30 to 50 probationers versus an average of 130 probationers, as smaller caseloads result in improved outcomes compared to large specialty caseloads and traditional probation.[^6]

Specialized probation often requires probationers to participate in treatment.[^7] Compared to traditional probation, research indicates specialty probation may be able to:

-	Increase participant access to mental health services.[^8]
-	Reduce participant probation violations and court appearances for noncompliance with treatment.[^9]
-	Decrease number of new arrests of participants.[^10]
-	Reduce participants’ days in jail.[^11]

Research by Skeem and colleagues indicated the effect of specialty probation on rearrest is dependent on the quality of the relationship between the probation officer and probationer.[^12] Specialty probation may be able to enhance the probation officer-client relationship by: 

-	Maintaining frequent contact with probationers.[^13]
-	Using problem-solving strategies in response to noncompliance.[^14]
-	Avoiding a coercive relationship by applying a “firm but fair” supervision style.[^15]
-	Employing graduated sanctions for violations.[^16]

A 2014 study demonstrated specialty probationers were about two times less likely to receive a formal probation violation compared to those on traditional probation. In addition, improved relationship quality between probation officer and probationer reduced the likelihood of receiving a violation.[^17]

An assessment of the type and quality of services received in mandated treatment is important when evaluating the program’s outcomes.[^18] Future research should examine the specific mechanisms by which specialty probation programs can improve mental health symptoms and reduce involvement with the criminal justice system.

<summary>Specialized Parole for Individuals with MHDs</summary>

There has been minimal research conducted on the effectiveness of specialty parole for individuals with MHDs. The California Division of Adult Parole Operations’ Mental Health Services Continuum Program features small caseloads, intensive supervision, and outpatient mental health treatment services at clinics in parole offices.[^19] Researchers found that program participants who attended at least one mental health treatment session were significantly less likely to be returned to custody.[^20] However, program participants had higher rates of technical violations and new offenses than their counterparts without MHDs.[^21] This program is rated “Promising” by [crimesolutions.gov](https://crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=445). 

A study of parole in New Jersey found that individuals with MHDs were more likely than those without MHDs to receive disciplinary actions during incarceration, which made release to parole less likely for those individuals.[^22] A study of a specialized parole program found parolees with psychiatric symptoms were more likely to violate conditions of parole but were not more likely to be rearrested for a new offense.[^23] These findings support the idea that parole officers may supervise parolees with MHDs more closely, leading to increased detection of parole violations.

<summary>Forensic Assertive Community Treatment (FACT)</summary>

Based on the ACT model, FACT programs serve the justice-involved population with the highest levels of mental health needs and greatest risk for negative behaviors (e.g. recidivism, self-harm).[^24] A multidisciplinary treatment team that includes stakeholders like a parole officer, psychiatrist, and case manager is available 24/7 to proactively address or respond to participants’ needs, such as mental health and substance use disorder treatment, transportation assistance, and vocational support.[^25] FACT specifically aims to reduce rearrests and reincarceration.[^26] FACT also leverages criminal justice sanctions (e.g. technical violation of parole) to promote compliance with the treatment plan.[^27] _See Intercept 4 for more information on FACT._
