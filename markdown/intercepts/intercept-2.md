Individuals with mental health disorders (MHDs) are less likely to be able to afford monetary bail, and more likely to remain in custody for longer periods of time if not diverted.[^1] In addition to negative consequences that all individuals face due to time spent in jail, such as disruption to routine and potential loss of employment or housing, even a short jail stay can be detrimental to an individual with a mental health condition if mental health treatment or access to medication is interrupted.[^2]

Following arrest, defendants with MHDs may be eligible for diversion from standard criminal justice processing and linked to mental health treatment in the community. Typically, a prosecutor or judge must give approval to pursue a diversion option. Diversion to treatment may be in lieu of prosecution or incarceration. Participation is usually voluntary.[^3] The specific characteristics of a post-arrest diversion model can be adapted to the needs and resources of the implementing jurisdiction. For example, diversion programs can be administered through the court system or through the jail. Jail-based diversion is typically carried out by pretrial services staff or specialized jail staff, whereas court-based diversion often employs a mental health professional.[^4]

While there may be some variation in court system and jail-based program implementation, post-arrest diversion is generally characterized by three main components:[^5]

- **Screening** of all individuals detained in jail to identify possible MHDs. [The Brief Jail Mental Health Screen](https://www.prainc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bjmhsform.pdf) is a validated screening tool developed by Policy Research Associates, Inc., and is available at no cost.[^6] The screening can be completed by jail staff at intake and qualifying individuals should be referred for further mental health assessment.
-	**Assessment** of an individual’s symptoms by mental health professionals during initial jail detention to provide a recommendation to the court.[^7] Jurisdictions that do not employ mental health professionals at this stage may task pre-trial services or defense counsel with conducting a mental health assessment.[^8]
-	**Negotiation** between criminal justice personnel and diversion staff (e.g. specialized jail staff or mental health professionals) to agree on a plan for community-based treatment and supervision.[^9]

The screening and identification processes are most efficient when conducted in the first 24 to 72 hours following arrest. This reduces pre-trial detention time for those with MHDs and provides access to needed mental health treatment.[^10] Some jurisdictions have created information sharing pathways from jails and courts to the local mental health system to streamline the eligibility determinations.[^11] In Illinois, the Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health operates the [Jail Data Link System](https://sisonline.dhs.state.il.us/jaillink/home.asp), which helps identify individuals involved in both the criminal justice and mental health systems.

Charges may be dismissed by the court upon successful completion of a mental health treatment plan (deferred prosecution).[^12] Mental health treatment staff ensure the confidentiality of information about an individual’s MHD; they only provide information on what the treatment plan is and whether the individual has complied with their treatment plan.[^13] If participants fail to comply with the conditions of diversion, the case may be returned to court for traditional criminal justice processing.[^14]

## Goals:

-	Increase access to mental health treatment.[^15]
-	Reduce further involvement in the criminal justice system.[^16]
-	Reduce use of pretrial detention and lessen jail overcrowding.[^17]
- Decrease costs to the criminal justice system.[^18]

## Eligibility:

Eligibility decisions for post-arrest diversion typically take into the account the circumstances and crime surrounding the individual’s arrest. Examples of different possible eligible offense types include:

-	Non-violent offense.
-	Low-level offense.
-	Offenses directly related to a mental health condition.[^19]

A multi-site study of post-arrest diversion programs indicated no significant differences in outcomes between individuals arrested for a violent offense and those arrested for a non-violent offense.[^20] This suggests diversion can be beneficial to individuals regardless of offense type.

Additionally, eligibility criteria may be based on the severity of mental health symptoms or type of diagnosis.[^21] For example, a post-arrest diversion program in Florida examines the following factors when determining a defendant’s eligibility: 

-	Severity of charges.
-	Criminal history.
-	Mental health history.[^22]

Jurisdictions may be limited in offering post-arrest diversion to mental health treatment due to mandatory sentencing policies that do not allow for diversion options.[^23] When diversion programs are limited to defendants facing very minor charges, potential participants may decline the opportunity for diversion because their sentences may be less burdensome than the requirements of a diversion program.[^24] Some individuals may choose not to participate due to the fear that sharing their mental health information may negatively bias the court and sentencing.[^25]

## Research Evidence:

Studies typically compare the outcomes of those diverted to those who go through standard criminal justice processing. Researchers also use individuals reentering the community from incarceration as a control group for those who were diverted post-arrest.[^26]

The findings of research on post-arrest diversion programs are mixed. Some research has shown post-arrest diversion programs may lead to:

-	Fewer days in jail.[^27]
-	Reduced recidivism.[^28]
-	More time in the community (e.g. not incarcerated or hospitalized in a psychiatric facility).[^29]
-	More mental health treatment for those in need.[^30] 
-	Improvements in mental health symptoms/conditions.[^31]

However, other research has shown potentially negative outcomes associated with post-arrest diversion, including increased use of emergency psychiatric services,[^32] reduced likelihood of receiving mental health medication,[^33] increased anxiety and psychiatric symptomology,[^34] and no meaningful reductions in recidivism[^35] or revocations of conditional release.[^36]

The Washington State Institute for Public Policy review of potential costs and savings associated with post-arrest diversion suggests potential for a monetary benefit per participant ($734) and a 51 percent chance that the benefits of the program will exceed the overall costs.[^37]

While potentially promising, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small number of studies conducted and the wide variation in interventions employed by programs under the term “diversion.” Many positive outcomes may be more dependent on the treatment and services received, and less a result of the diversion event.[^38]
