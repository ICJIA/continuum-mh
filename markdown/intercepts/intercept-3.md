Mental health courts are problem-solving courts that provide alternative sanctions aimed at reducing behaviors that may lead to incarceration.[^1] According to the Center for Court Innovation, problem-solving courts feature three core characteristics. They: 

1) Identify and address the underlying cause(s) of criminality for specific groups. 
2) Collaborate with members of the justice system, as well as members of the community. 
3) Offer accountability to increase compliance from court participants; ensure service providers offer necessary treatment; and require the court to monitor operations and outcomes.[^2] 

In mental health courts, individuals with mental health disorders (MHDs) are diverted from jail or prison and receive community-based treatment. Participants are required to comply with court conditions, with adherence monitored by a criminal justice agency and/or a mental health agency.[^3] The first mental health court was established in Broward County, Fla., in 1997[^4] and an estimated 350 mental health courts are now operating in the United States.[^5]

Jail personnel, defense attorneys, and direct service providers typically make referrals to mental health court upon determination of eligibility via screenings and assessments.[^6] The court proceedings of mental health courts are less adversarial than traditional criminal courts, with a greater focus on participant rehabilitation.[^7] Many mental health courts promote a team approach in which the defense counsel, prosecutors, judges, and mental health service case managers work together to achieve successful participant outcomes.[^8] However, critics argue that the less formal nature of proceedings may be detrimental to the defendant’s constitutional right to due process.[^9]

Mental health courts can be offered either pre- or post-adjudication.

- _Pre-adjudication model._ Upon successful completion of a mental health court program, initial charges may be dropped or reduced or the conviction may be vacated.[^10]
- _Post-adjudication model._ With this program model, the court may require a guilty plea and defer or suspend the sentence.[^11] In addition, participation is a condition of probation.[^12]

Failure to complete mental health court requirements may result in a variety of sanctions (e.g. more intense supervision, incarceration). Requiring a guilty plea in exchange for release from detention may be considered coercive.[^13] There are mixed findings on the association between participants’ perception of coercion and the efficacy of mental health treatment mandated by the criminal justice system, including mental health courts.[^14]

Individuals with more severe charges and/or lengthy criminal histories may be required to participate in mental health court for a longer duration.[^15] Frequency of contact between the court and participants is often determined by court docket size and court resources.[^16] Mental health court administrators should consider mental health treatment service capacity as they manage court caseloads.[^17]

## Goals:

Goals of mental health courts are to:

-	Reduce contact of individuals with MHDs and the justice system.
-	Connect individuals with MHDs to mental health treatment services. 
-	Reduce recidivism of individuals with MHDs.[^18]

## Eligibility:

Mental health courts target offenders with MHDs, but additional eligibility criteria vary across jurisdictions.[^19]

Eligibility criteria for mental health courts may include: 

-	History of an MHD or mental health treatment, apparent mental health symptoms while in custody, or formal assessment with a diagnostic screening tool.[^20]
- Charges of a nonviolent misdemeanor; however, more courts are allowing participation by those who commit felonies or more serious types of crime.[^21]
-	Voluntary participation in the court.[^22]

## Research Evidence:

Mental health courts are considered a [promising practice](https://www.crimesolutions.gov/PracticeDetails.aspx?ID=34), with additional rigorous research needed for the concept to be considered evidence-based.[^23] Participation in mental health court may:

-	**Reduce recidivism.**[^24] Individual studies have found mental health court participants:
	- Have fewer rearrests than those who receive “treatment as usual.”[^25]
	- Spend more time in the community before receiving any new charges.[^26]
	- Spend fewer days in jail than the control groups.[^27]
	-	Have a reduced risk of perpetrating violence in the year after participation.[^28]
-	**Increase access to mental health treatment.** Research has found mental health court participants have:
	- Increased engagement with mental health treatment services.[^29]
	-	Fewer uses of crisis or emergency services, or costlier in-patient treatment services than a comparison group.[^30]
	-	Decreased symptoms of psychological distress.[^31]

However, there are mixed findings on the results of the increased access to mental health treatment through mental health court participation. Some studies have found that mental health court participation is not associated with a reduction in clinical mental health symptoms;[^32] this may be due to the quality of treatment services received, which is often beyond the control of the mental health court.[^33] Further, a multi-site study of mental health courts did not find a significant relationship between receipt of treatment services and subsequent rearrests.[^34]

A significant amount of research is available on process outcomes and administration of mental health courts. Researchers reported an average mental health court graduation rate of 52 percent.[^35] Factors found to be associated with a failure to complete a mental health court program include:

-	Prior criminal behavior. 
-	Multiple diagnoses. 
-	Co-occurring substance use disorders.[^36]

Conversely, factors that were associated with greater likelihood of court program completion included being prescribed psychiatric medication and receiving disability benefits.[^37] Consistent findings on the impact of race and gender on mental health court completion are not available.[^38]

There are mixed findings regarding the costs and savings associated with mental health courts. The [Washington State Institute for Public Policy](http://www.wsipp.wa.gov/BenefitCost/Program/52) found mental health courts were associated with $5.62 in benefits for every dollar spent per participant and a 96 percent chance the benefits will exceed the costs of the program.[^39] In contrast, a quasi-experimental multi-site study found mental health courts were costlier per participant than standard criminal justice processing of a matched comparison group of individuals who received mental health services in jail.[^40] During court participation, there were slight savings in criminal justice costs for mental health court participants; however, three years after court participation, the increased cost of treatment eclipsed any funds saved.[^41] Still other research demonstrated mental health courts offered cost savings after 18 months[^42] and 24 months.[^43] 

When surveyed, 91 percent of participants in two mental health courts reported participation to be beneficial.[^44] Researchers found that participants in mental health courts reported low levels of perceived coercion and felt high levels of respect, fairness, and freedom to express opinions, compared to individuals with mental health disorders in standard criminal justice processing.[^45] An increased perception of procedural justice was associated with a decrease in symptoms during participation in the court.[^46] However, one study found 27 percent of participants had clinically significant impairments which may call into question their legal competence or ability to fully comprehend the court’s processes and requirements.[^47]
