The following are evidence-based programs and practices (EPBs) for individuals with mental health disorders (MHDs) that span multiple intercepts.

## Illness Management Recovery (IMR)

IMR aims to educate individuals with serious MHDs about their conditions and encourage them to take a proactive approach to setting treatment goals and managing symptoms.[^1] Participants are taught strategies to avoid mental health symptom relapse and effectively cope with their MHDs. The program is offered weekly over three months.[^2]

IMR is well-established as an EBP and may be able to:

-	Increase knowledge about MHDs. 
-	Improve medication adherence.
-	Reduce rehospitalizations.[^3]

In what little research exists on IMR for justice-involved individuals, researchers suggested adaptations for the population, such as specifically recognizing and altering criminogenic thinking.[^4] Cost-benefit analyses demonstrate a ratio of $3.04 in benefits for every $1 spent on the program.[^5]

## Family Psychoeducation (FPE)

FPE is an informative approach to help individuals with MHDs manage their symptoms by including family members in a supportive, team-based environment  in partnership with practitioners. In FPE, “family” can be a relative or any other supportive person invited by the individual to take part in their recovery. Generally, FPE is comprised of three stages over nine months, including:

-	Sessions bringing together consumers, family, and mental health professionals. 
-	An educational workshop about managing stress in the family. 
-	Ongoing psychoeducational group sessions for individuals with MHDs and their families.[^6]

Research indicates FPE may be able to:

-	Reduce hospitalizations.[^7] 
-	Improve global functioning and community integration in the long-term.[^8]  
-	Offer strategies to reduce the burden on relatives and caregivers.[^9]
-	Improve family relationships.[^10]
-	Offer cost savings on average per patient.[^11]

## Supportive Housing for Persons with MHDs

Homeless individuals with MHDs typically have high levels of involvement with the justice system.[^12] Supportive housing reduces homelessness and associated contact with the justice system, while allowing individuals with MHDs to receive psychiatric services in the community.[^13] No services are required as a condition of housing and participants are subject to the same rules as any other tenant.[^14] Through the program, individuals should spend no more than 30 percent of their income on rent and the assistance should not be time-limited.[^15]

Research indicates supportive housing may be able to reduce:

-	Emergency shelter stays.[^16]
-	Hospital stays and shorten their length.[^17]
-	Length of time incarcerated.[^18]
-	Rearrests and reincarceration after prison release.[^19]

## Supported Employment (SE) for Persons with MHDs

The goal of supported employment (SE) is to match individuals with serious MHDs to jobs in the community while offering comprehensive mental health services. SE does not require individuals to undergo pre-employment training to meet a definition of “work readiness,” but instead focuses on rapid job placement and supportive services to meet employment goals.[^20]

Supported employment has a strong evidence base of helping participants acquire and maintain employment in the competitive labor market.[^21]

Research indicates SE may also be able to:

-	Help individuals find work sooner.[^22]
-	Offer more working hours and more wage earnings.[^23]
-	Increase self-esteem in clients who engage in competitive work.[^24]

Cost-benefit analyses suggest SE can offer a savings of $3.04 for every dollar spent on program costs.[^25]

When the program’s target population is limited to justice-involved individuals, improved employment outcomes persist over time; however, supported employment had no significant impact on rearrests or reincarceration rates.[^26]

## Motivational Interviewing (MI)

MI promotes behavior change by helping individuals examine ambivalence, set goals, and consider actionable steps.[^27] Therapists use open-ended questioning, reflective listening, and employ affirmations to motivate participants to change their behavior.[^28] MI was originally developed for use with individuals with substance use disorders,[^29] but has been expanded for use with individuals with MHDs to promote treatment adherence and with individuals who are justice-involved to reduce recidivism.  

[Crimesolutions.gov](https://crimesolutions.gov/PracticeDetails.aspx?ID=31), the National Institute of Justice’s clearinghouse of EBPs, lists motivational interviewing as an EBP for treatment of substance abuse. MI also is often a component of practices that are evidence-based for improving mental health outcomes (e.g. Assertive Community Treatment).[^30]

For those with MHDs, MI may be able to:

-	Increase treatment engagement and medication adherence.[^31]
-	Improve mental health symptoms.[^32]
-	Reduce alcohol and illegal drug use for those with co-occurring substance use disorders.[^33]

## Integrated Co-Occurring Disorders Treatment

Integrated co-occurring disorders treatment aids individuals with a diagnosis of a mental health and substance use disorder, or co-occurring disorder (COD). About half of individuals in the United States who are diagnosed with severe MHDs are also affected by a substance use disorder.[^34] Individuals with a COD are at increased risk for criminal justice involvement.[^35] Individuals demonstrate improved outcomes related to recovery when receiving integrated treatment for both disorders from the same treatment team.[^36] Integrated treatment often incorporates elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and family psychoeducation programs. 

Individuals receiving treatment within non-integrated systems may be guided to sequentially address one disorder before the other or may receive separate treatment within each system (parallel treatment). These paths are less effective and more costly than integrated treatment.[^37]

COD treatment of those who are incarcerated can be ineffective due to the lack of resources in correctional settings to cover the high cost of services.[^38] Modifying in-prison residential substance abuse treatment programs (i.e. [therapeutic communities](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/therapeutic-communities/how-are-therapeutic-communities-integrated-criminal-justice-system)) to target individuals with CODs in prisons has demonstrated more positive outcomes for this population than typical therapeutic community programs or standard correctional mental health treatment, including:

-	Decreased substance use. 
-	Improved psychological functioning. 
-	Reduced recidivism.[^39]

Long-term follow-up with a mental health provider, known as aftercare, is essential for the success of individuals after completing prison-based COD treatment and returning to the community.[^40]

## Psychopharmacology

Prescribed psychotropic medication can be used to reduce symptoms of MHDs by altering the chemistry of the brain.[^41] All [FDA-approved](https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/ProductsApprovals/ucm106288.htm) medications have been subject to rigorous clinical trials and are evidence-based. This type of treatment should be viewed as a medical decision tailored to an individual’s specific needs.[^42] Individuals with MHDs should actively participate in decision-making when selecting medication.[^43] For effective treatment leading to recovery, medication may need to be part of a long-term treatment plan.[^44]

One evidence-based approach to medication management is MedTEAM (Medication Treatment, Evaluation and Management) which employs a team approach by promoting collaboration between prescribers, agency staff, other mental health practitioners, and consumers to systematically determine the impacts of medication.[^45] This can be accomplished by consistently employing brief rating scales to measure impacts of medication on desired outcomes over time.[^46]

Research indicates MedTEAM may be able to improve: 

-	Clinical symptoms. 
-	Treatment quality.
-	Adherence to treatment. 
-	Consumer satisfaction.[^47]

Jails and prisons may have a limited variety of prescription medications available in the facilities. In addition, staff psychiatrists may be instructed to give preference to medications that are less expensive, less likely to be diverted/misused, and extended-release formulations that do not require multiple doses throughout the day.[^48] In addition, a federal court ruled that states are required to supply individuals with the necessary prescription medications to ensure continuity of care between release from prison and receipt of a prescription in the community.[^49]

A study of individuals released from Florida psychiatric hospitals found that the receipt of medications for 90 days post-hospitalization significantly reduced the likelihood of arrest.[^50] Further, individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder who were referred for expedited enrollment in Medicaid upon release from prison were significantly more likely to fill a prescription in the community for mental health medication.[^51]
