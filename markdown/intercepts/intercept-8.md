## Description: 

The majority of individuals in the justice system have experienced trauma, and a portion go on to suffer from a trauma-related disorder, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[^1] PTSD has been found to be up to 10 times more common in the correctional population than in individuals in the community.[^2] Trauma-informed therapies have been shown to be effective modalities for treating those who have experienced trauma, including those who have developed PTSD. They also are relatively simple for prison staff to integrate into their supervision practices.[^3]

Trauma-informed therapies aim to identify trauma and create structures within care settings that acknowledge the impact of trauma on people’s lives.[^4] In institutional settings, a trauma-informed approach acknowledges that prison and jail environments can amplify symptoms of trauma.[^5]  [The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA)](https://www.samhsa.gov/nctic/trauma-interventions) outlines six key principles for the development of a trauma-informed approach: 

1.	Safety
2.	Trustworthiness and Transparency
3.	Peer support
4.	Collaboration and mutuality
5.	Empowerment, voice and choice
6.	Cultural, Historical, and Gender Issues[^6]

## Goals:

The goal of trauma-informed therapy is to address the trauma in a justice-involved individual’s history, specifically in relation to behaviors that contribute to recidivism. In the case of correctional facilities, trauma-informed principles can affect practices related to many areas, including treatment, intake, and professional development for staff. SAMHSA proposes four key principles of trauma-informed approaches:

-	Realization of the effects of trauma.
-	Recognition of the signs and manifestations of trauma.
-	Response with application of trauma-informed practices throughout the organization.
-	Resistance to re-traumatization of both clients and staff.[^7]

## Eligibility:

These types of therapies can be used in many settings and with patients of all ages. Due to the high rate of trauma exposure among individuals in correctional settings and limited resources with which to address it, some programs limit eligibility to those with the most severe symptoms or those who are diagnosed with PTSD.[^8] Validated trauma screening and assessment tools can be used to accurately identify the appropriate population for these services.[^9]

## Research Evidence:

Trauma-informed therapies can:

-	Improve symptoms of trauma and stressor-related disorders.[^10]
-	Reduce negative mental health symptoms, including depression and anxiety.[^11]
-	Improve skills and abilities to cope with trauma.[^12]
-	Increase sense of personal safety.[^13]

Because trauma-informed care is a framework implemented at the program or organizational level, it can be difficult for research to isolate the specific impact of trauma-informed practices.

## Examples in the Field:

**Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy (TARGET)** is a trauma-informed intervention to treat PTSD and co-occurring disorders helping individuals develop new coping behaviors.[^14] The curriculum is centered on development of self-monitoring skills by participants.

Research indicates TARGET can:

-	Alleviate symptoms of PTSD.[^15]
-	Reduce negative behavioral incidents leading to disciplinary sanctions in correctional settings.[^16]

TARGET is included in SAMHSA’s National Registry of Evidence-based Program and Practices (NREPP)[^17] and listed as an effective practice by [crimesolutions.gov](https://www.crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=145).[^18]

Other evidence-based programs and practices for the treatment of trauma include:

-	[Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)](https://crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=195).[^19]
-	[Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM)](http://www.cebc4cw.org/program/trauma-recovery-and-empowerment-model/detailed).[^20]
