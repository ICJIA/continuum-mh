## Description: 

Behavioral interventions work to change the behavior of individual clients, teaching self-monitoring to reinforce new coping skills to handle stressful situations. Cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy are examples of effective behavioral intervention techniques. These therapies can be used across intercepts.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): 

CBT is a form of structured talk therapy administered by a therapist or psychotherapist.[^1] Unlike other forms of talk therapy, which can last for months or years, clients attend 10 to 20  structured sessions.[^2] CBT is based on the cognitive model, which holds that a person’s perception of a situation is determined more by their own reaction to an event than the actual event itself.[^3] CBT has been found to be effective in treating a number of mental health disorders (MHDs) by encouraging recognition of problematic thinking patterns and teaching problem-solving skills to cope with difficult situations.[^4]

### Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): 

DBT is a cognitive behavioral approach to therapy that was developed in the late 1980s.[^5] The term _dialectic_ refers to embracing both acceptance and change, allowing individuals to feel supported and validated when being asked to make changes.[^6] DBT employs the dialectical philosophy to focus on emotional regulation, as well as mindfulness and acceptance.[^7] Therapists must be trained and certified to administer DBT, and many therapists employ DBT “consultation teams” to ensure fidelity to the approach.[^8]

## Goals:

CBT and DBT teach individuals to observe, evaluate, and regulate their own behavior to:

-	Change unhealthy behaviors and thought patterns.[^9]
-	Develop coping mechanisms to increase distress tolerance.[^10]
-	Reduce recidivism by learning to manage negative reactions and behaviors.[^11]

## Eligibility:

While eligibility criteria may vary based on the program, CBT and DBT can be used to treat many problematic behaviors. However, due to limited resources in most jail and court settings, participation in these programs is usually limited to individuals with a severe mental health and/or substance use disorder.[^12] Both CBT and DBT are effective therapeutic models for the justice-involved population, especially for those classified as medium to high risk for recidivism.[^13]

## Research Evidence and Examples in the Field:

<details>
	
<summary>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</summary>

Overall, CBT has a significant evidence base; however, the outcomes differ somewhat depending on the disorder that the practice is intended to treat.[^14] CBT has been shown to be effective in treating depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and severe mental illness, among others.[^15]

Research indicates CBT may be able to:

-	Improve symptoms of MHDs.[^16]
-	Reduce recidivism.[^17]
-	Reduce substance use.[^18]

There is some evidence that CBT may be more effective with juveniles, because their thinking patterns are not as deeply ingrained as adults’ and are more easily altered.[^19]

#### Examples in the Field
	
[Seeking Safety](http://www.cebc4cw.org/program/seeking-safety-for-adults/) is a curriculum-based program for individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders.[^20] It has been used with success in treating women in correctional settings.[^21] The program integrates CBT and trauma-informed care.[^22] Research indicates Seeking Safety may be able to:

-	Reduce trauma symptoms.[^23]
-	Increase treatment retention.[^24]
-	Improve interpersonal relationships.[^25]
-	Decrease illegal drug use.[^26]

Clients report high levels of satisfaction with the Seeking Safety program.[^27] The National Institute of Justice’s clearinghouse of research on programs and practices, [Crimesolutions.gov](https://crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=424), rates Seeking Safety as a “Promising” program.

A similar program for women with co-occurring disorders is the [Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM)](http://www.cebc4cw.org/program/trauma-recovery-and-empowerment-model/detailed).[^28]

[Reasoning & Rehabilitation (R&R)](https://whatworks.csgjusticecenter.org/intervention/reasoning-and-rehabilitation-enhanced-thinking-skills) is a CBT-based program that teaches prosocial behaviors to adults and juveniles in the justice system. These skills are taught in small group settings of six to 12 participants over 36 sessions.[^29]

Research indicates R&R can:

-	Reduce rearrests.[^30]
-	Improve employment outcomes.[^31]
-	Increase problem-solving skills and coping strategies.[^32]

R&R has been adapted for justice-involved youth and adults with MHDs in a program called [R&R2 MHP](https://www.cognitivecentre.ca/content/rr2). This program is delivered over 16 sessions and incorporates a structured mentoring component by assigning each participant a “PAL” (Participant’s Aid for Learning) who provides individual coaching between group sessions.[^33] An evaluation of R&R2 MHP found that those who completed the program self-reported less violent attitudes and facility staff reported less disruptive behavior from participants, compared to before program implementation.[^34]

Similar CBT programs for individuals involved in the criminal justice system include:

-	[Moral Reconation Therapy](http://www.moral-reconation-therapy.com/).[^35]
-	[Thinking for a Change](https://nicic.gov/thinking-change-40).[^36]

</details>

<details>
	<summary>Dialectical Behavior Therapy</summary>

Research indicates DBT may be able to:

-	Reduce incidents of self-harm and suicidal behavior.[^37]
-	Reduce hospitalizations.[^38]
-	Improve treatment retention.[^39]
-	Decrease treatment costs.[^40]

#### Example in the Field
	
Dialectical Behavior Therapy – Corrections Modified (DBT-CM) adapts standard DBT for use in correctional facilities. Modifications from traditional DBT include:

-	Fewer individual therapy sessions (due to limited resources).
-	Training to develop new coping skills that are relevant to the correctional setting and/or combat criminal behaviors.
-	Modifying group therapy sessions to enhance safety/security.[^41]

The program includes16 weeks of skills training and eight weeks of follow-up coaching.[^42] DBT-CM can:

-	Reduce negative behaviors that require in-prison disciplinary action.
-	Reduce aggression.
-	Improve coping.[^43]
